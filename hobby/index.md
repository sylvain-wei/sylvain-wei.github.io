# Reading

*"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one." - George R.R. Martin*

Reading provides an opportunity for a dialogue with oneself. I am deeply interested in essays, novels, poetry, and biographies by both domestic and foreign authors. I have been extensively reading in the past, present, and will continue to do so in the future, exploring books on literature, history, art, management, philosophy, and other subjects. Currently, I am engrossed in "Zeng Guofan" by Senlin Hu, and "The Effective Manager." by Peter F. Drucker. This year, alongside my research studies, I plan to read 15 books of various genres. I hope to engage in fruitful exchanges and communication with fellow enthusiasts who share a passion for reading, just like me.

Recently, I will read books like:

# Music

I have a great passion for music, especially experimental rock tracks and emotionally stirring ballads. Through these genres, I can deeply sense the brilliance of human nature resonating within the rhythm and emotions.

I adore the music composed by Tayu Lo, as his songs express sincere emotions towards our nation and possess a keen awareness of the times. They also encapsulate the wondrous experiences of childhood and love. Additionally, I have been gradually exploring Western music lately. The unparalleled talent and genuine human compassion showcased in the works of artists like Lady Gaga, Elton John, and The Beatles have truly captivated me and allowed me to experience the enchantment of music. I also appreciate piano compositions, such as the works of Ryuichi Sakamoto. 
Despite my mediocre singing abilities, I enjoy singing, and I plan to embark on learning instruments like the guitar in the near future.


# Running

I enjoy running, although I'm not skilled in sprinting or long-distance running. I consider running as a source of pleasure because it allows me to release stress and feel the power of life. (The following image is a group photo of me taken at the Winter Marathon Festival on November 25, 2023.)

# Past Hobbies

In the past, I enjoyed painting, calligraphy, and other artistic pursuits, but I was not proficient in any of them. I hope to pick up these hobbies again in the future and become more skilled at them.
