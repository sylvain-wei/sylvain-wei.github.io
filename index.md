Here is **Shaohang WEI (Sylvain, È≠èÂ∞ëÊù≠)**.

I am a senior student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Beihang University (BUAA)**. Currently, I am also a student in [Institute of Computational Linguistic (ICL)](https://icl.pku.edu.cn), **Peking University**, advised by **Prof. Houfeng Wang**. Starting from the fall of 2024, I will officially enroll as a PhD student in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn) at **Peking University**. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, please feel free to reach out to me via **email** at - *weish@buaa.edu.cn* or **WeChat** - *sylvain4ai*. 

I will continue to update my blog on the homepage with my technical insights and personal reflections. Your support and attention are greatly appreciated!

## Research Interests

**<font color='red'>[Highlight]</font> I am actively looking for a research internship opportunity in the field of NLP/LLM from March to August 2024. Please contact me if you have any leads!**

- Interpretability and Mechanisms of Large Language Models
- Natural Language Understanding
- Self-supervised Learning
- Graph Representation Learning

My research interests are interdisciplinary, with a primary focus on (1) the evaluation, mechanisms, and interpretability of **large language models (LLM)**. I also specialize in (2) developing advanced techniques for **natural language understanding (NLU)**. Additionally, I have a strong interest in *self-supervised learning (SSL)* and *graph representation learning*. I am driven by a passion for exploring the fundamental principles that underlie artificial intelligence technologies.
