I am a senior student in Artificial Intelligence at **Beihang University**. Starting from the fall of 2024, I will officially enroll as a Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computational Linguistic (ICL)](https://icl.pku.edu.cn) at **Peking University**. 

I will continue to update my blogs on the web with my technical insights and personal reflections. Your support and attention are greatly appreciated! If you are interested in any aspect of me, please feel free to reach out to me via **email** at - *weish@buaa.edu.cn* or **WeChat** - *sylvain4ai*. 

## Research Interests

*<font color='blue'>[Highlight]</font> I am actively looking for a research internship opportunity in NLP/LLM from Mar to Aug 2024. Please contact me if you have any leads!*

- Interpretability and Mechanisms of Large Language Models
- Natural Language Understanding
- Self-supervised Learning
- Graph Representation Learning

My research interests are interdisciplinary, with a primary focus on (1) the evaluation, mechanisms, and interpretability of **large language models (LLM)**. I also specialize in (2) developing advanced techniques for **natural language understanding (NLU)**. Additionally, I have a strong interest in *self-supervised learning (SSL)* and *graph representation learning*. I am driven by a passion for exploring the fundamental principles that underlie artificial intelligence technologies.
