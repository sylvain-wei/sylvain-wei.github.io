<!-- I am a senior student in Artificial Intelligence at **Beihang University**. Starting from the fall of 2024, I will officially enroll as a Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computational Linguistic (ICL)](https://icl.pku.edu.cn) at **Peking University**.  -->

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Institute of Computational Linguistic (ICL)](https://icl.pku.edu.cn) at Peking University.

<!-- I will continue to update my blogs on the web with my technical insights and personal reflections. Your support and attention are greatly appreciated! If you are interested in any aspect of me, please feel free to reach out to me via **email** - *weish@buaa.edu.cn* or **WeChat** - *sylvain4ai*.  -->

## Research Topics

<!-- *<font color='blue'>[Highlight]</font> I am actively looking for a research internship opportunity in NLP/LLM from Mar to Aug 2024. Please contact me if you have any leads!* -->
My goal is to enable machines to **truly understand human natural language**. This requires a deep exploration of transparent, white-box decision-making processes. Only a model that can dynamically learn, update its world knowledge, and reason like a human can function as a reliable intelligence.

- Interpretability and Mechanisms of Large Language Models.
- Reliable Artificial Intelligence.
- Multi-modal Large Language Models.
